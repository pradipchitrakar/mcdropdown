mcdropdown
==========

This plugin is an update of mcdropdown jQuery plug-in v 1.3.2 (http://www.givainc.com/labs/mcdropdown_jquery_plugin.htm)

mcdropdown features:

    Creates a multi-column hierarchical select UI component
    Binds a text input field or div element to a list element (included nested lists)
    Menus are automatically split into columns as needed
    Menus are positioned to always stay on the screen
    Autocomplete keyboard entry (only valid options are allowed)
    Menu automatically scrolls into viewport when opened

mcdropdown works with jQuery version upto 1.6.2 only. I made some changes to work with jquery 1.9. 

Changes:
- Replaced removed functions like curCSS(),andSelf()
- Fixed bug for google chrome
